        <h2>How to Make Buttermilk Pancakes</h2>
        <p>It's really quite easy to make perfect buttermilk pancakes at home. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what to expect:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>

            <li>Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
            
            <li>Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown</li>
            
        </ol>    

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</p>

        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</p>

        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</p>

        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <p>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
